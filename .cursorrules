Component Development
- Create .svelte files for Svelte components.
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use Svelte's props for data passing.
- Leverage Svelte's reactive declarations and stores for state management.
- Utilize shadcn-svelte components for common UI elements.

Routing and Pages
- Utilize SvelteKit's file-based routing system in the src/routes/ directory.
- Implement dynamic routes using [slug] syntax.
- Use load functions for server-side data fetching and pre-rendering.
- Implement proper error handling with +error.svelte pages.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Leverage SvelteKit's SSR capabilities for dynamic content.
- Implement SSG for static pages using prerender option.
- Use the adapter-auto for automatic deployment configuration.

Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Integrate Tailwind CSS with SvelteKit using svelte-add.
- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Svelte components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
- Implement custom theme extensions in tailwind.config.js when necessary.
- Avoid using the @apply directive; prefer direct utility classes in HTML.
- Use Tailwind's @layer directive for custom utilities when needed.

shadcn-svelte Integration
- Install and configure shadcn-svelte in your SvelteKit project.
- Use shadcn-svelte components for common UI elements like buttons, forms, and modals.
- Customize shadcn-svelte components using Tailwind CSS classes.
- Implement shadcn-svelte's theming system for consistent design across your application.
- Utilize shadcn-svelte's accessibility features for improved user experience.

PocketBase Integration
- Set up PocketBase as your backend service.
- Use PocketBase SDK in your SvelteKit application for data management.
- Implement real-time subscriptions using PocketBase's real-time API.
- Utilize PocketBase's authentication system for user management.
- Implement proper error handling for PocketBase operations.
- Use PocketBase's file storage capabilities for managing user uploads.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage SvelteKit's SSR and SSG.
- Implement code splitting using SvelteKit's dynamic imports.
- Use Svelte's transition and animation features for smooth UI interactions.
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Optimize Tailwind CSS output using PurgeCSS in production builds.

Data Fetching
- Use load functions for server-side data fetching with PocketBase.
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.
- Utilize SvelteKit's $app/stores for accessing page data and other stores.

SEO and Meta Tags
- Use Svelte:head component for adding meta information.
- Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
- Create reusable SEO components for consistent meta tag management.

State Management
- Use Svelte stores for global state management.
- Leverage context API for sharing data between components.
- Implement proper store subscriptions and unsubscriptions.

Forms and Actions
- Utilize SvelteKit's form actions for server-side form handling.
- Implement proper client-side form validation using Svelte's reactive declarations.
- Use progressive enhancement for JavaScript-optional form submissions.
- Leverage shadcn-svelte form components for consistent form styling.

API Routes
- Create API routes in the src/routes/api/ directory.
- Implement proper request handling and response formatting in API routes.
- Use SvelteKit's hooks for global API middleware.
- Integrate PocketBase operations within API routes when necessary.

Authentication
- Implement authentication using PocketBase's authentication system.
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management.
- Implement proper CSRF protection for forms and API routes.
- Utilize shadcn-svelte components for login and registration forms.

Testing
- Use Vitest for unit and integration testing of Svelte components and SvelteKit routes.
- Implement end-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress.
- Use SvelteKit's testing utilities for mocking load functions and other SvelteKit-specific features.
- Test PocketBase integrations using mock data and test databases.

Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Svelte components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.
- Use Svelte's bind:this for managing focus programmatically.
- Leverage shadcn-svelte's built-in accessibility features.

Key Conventions
1. Follow the official SvelteKit, shadcn-svelte, Tailwind CSS, and PocketBase documentation for best practices and conventions.
2. Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging.
4. Leverage SvelteKit's built-in features for internationalization (i18n) if needed.
5. Use SvelteKit's asset handling for optimized static asset delivery.

Performance Metrics
- Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
- Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring.
- Optimize PocketBase queries and real-time subscriptions for efficiency.
